1. Name
mosquitto-tls â€” Configure SSL/TLS support for Mosquitto

2. Description
mosquitto provides SSL support for encrypted network connections and authentication. This manual describes how to create the files needed.

3. Note
It is important to use different certificate subject parameters for your CA, server and clients. If the certificates appear identical, even though generated separately, the broker/client will not be able to distinguish between them and you will experience difficult to diagnose errors.

4. Certificate Authority
Generate a certificate authority certificate and key.

openssl req -new -x509 -days <duration> -extensions v3_ca -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt

5. Server
Generate a server key.

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048
Generate a server key without encryption.

openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
Generate a certificate signing request to send to the CA.

openssl req -out server.csr -key server.key -new
Send the CSR to the CA, or sign it with your CA key:

openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days <duration>

6. Client
Generate a client key.

openssl genrsa -des3 -out client.key 2048
Generate a certificate signing request to send to the CA.

openssl req -out client.csr -key client.key -new
Send the CSR to the CA, or sign it with your CA key:

openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days <duration>
